+Build a mobile web app using python - not Flask - and javascript/html for an in-person event that allows attendees to scan a QR code to receive a 10 dollars LocalCash™ voucher in their account. Include functionality for users to load an additional amount - minimum $10 - from a specified source into their LocalCash account. Each vendor at the event should have a unique QR code that, when scanned, allows the user to purchase an item and updates the user's balance and points accordingly. Points are earned at a rate of 10 percent, and 250 points equals $1 LocalCash. Users should be able to repeat the process of loading money to their LocalCash account and making purchases at the event. After making at least $20 LocalCash of purchases, users should have the option to purchase a pre-packaged gift basket which is also $20 LocalCash. In a future version we will implement a live leader-board for an event screen that displays the number of users who've used the web app, the most popular purchases, and the top points earners - but the live leaderboard will not be included in this demo. After the event, the points they've earned should remain. If you want to use Django, I can provide a secret key for Django.

+
+FAQ
+Q: Could you please provide more details on how the QR code scanning process should work to receive the 10 dollars LocalCash™ voucher and how it should be linked to the user's account?
+
+A: The QR code will be the same for all users, the QR is a unique URL that asks for phone number. The way that a user is only limited to 10 dollars is because the eGift of 10 dollars has a limit of one per each unique 10 digit phone number (US only). In this way, their phone number is the primary key for the user, although it would be good to follow up after asking for the phone number with three additional fields: first name, last name, and zip code.
+
+Q: Could you please clarify the mechanism for users to load additional money into their LocalCash account? What are the specified sources for loading money?
+
+A: Stripe API to load money from a credit card or bank account. You can use example/sandbox module for Stripe as a placeholder. Stripe has been installed with PIP, but the Stripe can instead be a placeholder for Stripe and fake transaction for the demo.
+
+Q: Could you please explain how the unique QR code for each vendor should work and how it should update the user's balance and points?
+
+A: These QR codes are different than the eGift QR because they are unique for each vendor. There will be a sign at each vendor's event table, and the QR code will have a URL embedded. At the end of the URL will be an attribute for the amount of the purchase, such as A=2 means Amount = 2 dollars LocalCash. The points are not unique to each merchant, but instead of calculated to be earned at a rate of 10 percent. So a 20 dollars purchase results in 2 dollars earned as points, which equals 500 points because the value of the points is 1/250. There are 250 points per dollar earned. 
+
+Q: Could you please provide more details on the implementation of the live leaderboard? What specific metrics should it display and how should it be updated? 
+
+A: The Live Leaderboard will be in a future version, but not this demo. Live leaderboard will show the top user - by first name and last initial - at the top, and the amount of points they have earned (not money they have spent), and a separate row will show the most popular purchases. Use the following items for the demo web app: $2 cookie, $4 kombucha, $6 pie in a jar, and $8 house plant.
+
+Q: Could you please clarify the process of repeating the loading of money and making purchases? Is there a limit to how many times a user can load money or make purchases?
+
+A: They can load more money by tapping an account icon and then "Load money" to their account, as many times as they want. No limit. 
+
+Q: Could you please provide more details on the option to purchase a pre-packaged gift basket after making at least $20 LocalCash of purchases? How should this feature be implemented?
+
+A: Yes, after they have spent at least $20 LocalCash it will unlock the option to buy a gift basket that has all of the items included (cookie, kombucha, pie in a jar, and a succulent plant in an artistic planter). The gift basket is $20. So if they do not have enough funds, they will see the Load money" button. But if they have enough LocalCash they will see a "Pay" button for the unlocked gift basket. The gift basket will not need a QR code and is not associated with one vendor.
+
+Q: Could you please clarify what should happen to the points earned by users after the event? Should they remain in the user's account for future use or expire after a certain period?
+
+A: Points expire 6 months after they are earned. Also, they will have more opportunities to earn points after the event, but that is out of scope for this demo.
+
+Q: Could you please provide more details on how the leaderboard should be updated in real-time? What technology or method should be used to ensure that the leaderboard displays the most current data?
+
+A: All users will be in the same room and their phones will be connected to the internet, so the web app that they view on their devices will keep track of their usage and maintain a current database. 
+
+
+Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:
+
+1. User class: This will represent a user in the system. It will have fields for the user's phone number, first name, last name, zip code, balance, and points.
+
+2. Vendor class: This will represent a vendor at the event. It will have fields for the vendor's name and unique QR code.
+
+3. Purchase class: This will represent a purchase made by a user. It will have fields for the user, vendor, amount, and points earned.
+
+4. Leaderboard class: This will represent the leaderboard. It will have methods to calculate the top users and most popular purchases. But this is a placeholder because we will not implement a leaderboard in this demo.
+
+5. load_money function: This will handle loading money into a user's account.
+
+6. make_purchase function: This will handle making a purchase and updating the user's balance and points.
+
+7. scan_qr_code function: This will handle scanning a QR code and updating the user's balance and points. Users' phones already have a QR code scanner in their camera, so do not build a scanner.
+
+8. purchase_gift_basket function: This will handle purchasing a gift basket and updating the user's balance and points.

+Django project name: Localight eGift. Django apps: No, you choose. No preferred directory structure, but I am curious if you think microservices or a monolithic structure are best. Naming convention: Up to you. Secret key location: This is a demo so just store it in a separate config file. QR code scanning: Just tell the user to scan with their phone's built in camera QR scanner, do not try to make a scanner within the app. For example, Apple's latest camera app will automatically direct a QR code to a URL, so we only need to think about the URL web app view. Make purchases: Simply by tapping "Pay" button, very simple, with confirmation showing updated account balance. Load money with Stripe, but it is ok if it is in demo, and you can use the following sandbox keys: Publishable key: "pk_test_51NUfRnER8Gw2gWMvxCE8SJaeN1pMb8smHeFCz7745ZU6M2zHVRYdCRXMcdmb8Aqoof06Z0ohwiCRfva9wpwWsxqu00ghHGbcZM" Secret key: "sk_test_51NUfRnER8Gw2gWMvtgdUZVFTucNKne9Me7OdoCEpR7Ef92r0Q3M6rco9bTl8TGie7vZxBQOuGD6dQ0b4fZV54EbD00mqbXDrkS". Keep in mind that the user doesn't make each purchase for each item through a payment method — instead the user loads money into their LocalCash balance first, and then uses their LocalCash. So the gift basket purchase is the same "Pay" button when decrements their LocalCash balance. 

# 2023-07-16 18:02:58.178039
+I made all of these directories with read-write access except for "localight_egift/gift_basket/" because a gift basket should be considered a purchase, but with a variable added like "basket". If you agree, please proceed implementing.

+Looks good. Main suggestion is to include short but helpful text for the user, to guide them toward available options, and if they try to do something that they can't (like buy a gift basket early) tell them how close they are to being able to have an option available.
